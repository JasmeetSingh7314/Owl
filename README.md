# Owl

## Project Description:
### Owl is the ultimate platform where you can buy and sell games. 

Through Owl we want to **revolutionize** the world of **gaming**. For each game you buy on OWL,it will generate an **NFT** for that(different NFTs will be generated for different game) and with that nft you will get the **license key** for that game.Which then will be used to activate the game once it has been bought.

- For every game you buy, *the proof of transaction* will be pushed onto the blockchain proving your ownership and removing the risk of ever losing the ownership of that game.
- You can also **resell** the games that you have already bought once again(reusable licenses), the number of times you can resell is limited. 

## Problems we are solving -

- Piracy and Security 

- Centralization

- Non-fractional Ownership(single entity ownership) 

- Non-transferble licenses


## Tech Stack - 

### Frontend - 

- ReactJS+Vite

- Typescript

- Tailwind CSS

- Taquito (*for interacting with the smart contract*)

- Beacon SDK (*for interacting with the wallet*)

### Backend - 

- NodeJS

- IGDB api (*for getting information about the games*)
